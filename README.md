# Color_Identification
This python code identifies the colors in an image.
It gives the color represented by the particular pixel at a location in an image.
You can use any image whose colors you want to know. Just replace the image path in " img = cv2.imread("AllColorImage.jpg") " to the image path of your image file.
During Runtime, an image window will pop up to show the image. You will have to double click on certain position of the image to get the color of that pixel.
Once you got the color name and rgb values you can press ESC key to close the image window and the program ends.
